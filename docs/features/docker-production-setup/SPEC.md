# Docker Production Setup Specification

## Overview
This feature implements a production-ready Docker setup for our application, ensuring consistent Node.js versions across development, CI/CD, and production environments.

## Problem Statement
We need to ensure our application runs consistently across all environments and is optimized for production deployment. Currently, there are discrepancies between our development Node.js version and CI/CD configuration, and we lack a production-optimized Docker setup.

### User Stories
- As a developer, I want to ensure the same Node.js version is used across all environments to prevent version-related issues
- As a DevOps engineer, I want a production-optimized Docker image to deploy our application efficiently
- As a maintainer, I want clear documentation on how to build and deploy the Docker image

### Requirements
#### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Production Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- [ ] Consistent Node.js LTS version (20.x) across all environments
- [ ] Updated GitHub workflow configuration
- [ ] Docker build optimization for production
- [ ] Security hardening in production container

#### Non-functional Requirements
- [ ] Build time optimization
- [ ] Minimal production image size
- [ ] Security best practices implementation
- [ ] Clear documentation and examples

## Technical Design

### Architecture
The production Docker setup will use a multi-stage build process:
1. Build stage: Compile TypeScript, build Next.js application
2. Production stage: Minimal runtime environment with only necessary files

### Dependencies
- Node.js 20 LTS
- Next.js (latest stable)
- Docker BuildKit features
- GitHub Actions

### Implementation Details
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
# ... build process

# Production stage
FROM node:20-alpine
# ... production setup
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Alignment
- [ ] Update GitHub workflow Node.js version to 20 LTS
- [ ] Verify development container Node.js version
- [ ] Document Node.js version requirements

### Phase 2: Production Docker Setup
- [ ] Create production Dockerfile
- [ ] Implement multi-stage build
- [ ] Optimize build process
- [ ] Add security hardening

### Phase 3: Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Add build and deployment documentation
- [ ] Test build process
- [ ] Verify production image
- [ ] Update contribution guidelines

## Testing Strategy

### Build Tests
- Verify successful build in CI environment
- Check image size optimization
- Validate Node.js version consistency

### Security Tests
- Run security scanning on production image
- Verify non-root user implementation
- Check for sensitive data exposure

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Docker build instructions
- [ ] Environment setup guide
- [ ] Production deployment guide
- [ ] Version management documentation

## Security Considerations
- Use non-root user in production
- Implement least privilege principle
- Scan for vulnerabilities in base images
- Remove development dependencies in production

## Performance Requirements
- Production image size < 500MB
- Build time < 5 minutes in CI
- Optimal layer caching strategy

## Future Considerations
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Multi-architecture image support
- Container orchestration setup
- Automated image updates
