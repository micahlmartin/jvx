# Toolbar Feature Specification

## Overview
The toolbar provides essential navigation and control functionality for the JSON Graph Visualizer, including file operations, view controls, and application settings.

## Problem Statement
Users need a consistent and accessible way to interact with the application's core functionality.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to create, open, and save JSON files
- As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes
- As a user, I want to show/hide the sidebar
- As a user, I want to access common actions through a familiar interface

### Requirements
#### Functional Requirements
- [ ] File menu (New, Open, Save, Save As)
- [ ] View menu (Theme toggle, sidebar toggle)
- [ ] Consistent styling with design system
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility
- [ ] Proper state management

#### Non-functional Requirements
- [ ] Response time < 100ms for all actions
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Support for both mouse and keyboard interaction
- [ ] Consistent behavior across platforms

## Technical Design

### Architecture
The toolbar is implemented as a React component composed of smaller, focused components for each menu type.

### Component Design
```typescript
interface MenuBarProps {
  documents: Document[];
  activeDocument: string | null;
  onDocumentSelect: (id: string) => void;
  onDocumentClose: (id: string) => void;
}

interface Document {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  content: string;
  isDirty: boolean;
}
```

### State Management
- Document state managed through React context
- Theme state managed through ThemeContext
- Sidebar state managed through SidebarContext

### Dependencies
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Custom hooks for state management

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Structure
- [x] Basic toolbar layout
- [x] File menu implementation
- [x] View menu implementation

### Phase 2: State Management
- [x] Document state management
- [x] Theme toggle functionality
- [x] Sidebar toggle functionality

## Documentation Requirements
- [x] Component API documentation
- [x] Usage examples
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts
- [x] State management guide

## Design Assets
See `IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed design specifications and component structure.

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% keyboard accessibility
- [ ] < 100ms response time
- [ ] Zero accessibility violations
- [ ] Consistent behavior across browsers

## Security Considerations
- File operations limited to user-initiated actions
- No sensitive data stored in state

## Accessibility Requirements
- [x] ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- [x] Keyboard navigation support
- [x] High contrast support
- [x] Screen reader compatibility

## Performance Requirements
- [ ] No layout shifts during interaction
- [ ] Smooth animations (60fps)
- [ ] Minimal bundle size impact
