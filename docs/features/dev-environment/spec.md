# Development Environment Feature Specification

## Overview
A standardized development environment setup for JVX microservices that ensures consistent, efficient, and maintainable development across multiple services with different runtime requirements.

## Problem Statement
Development teams working on JVX microservices face challenges with inconsistent environments, complex setup procedures, and difficulties switching between services. This leads to reduced productivity and potential production issues due to environment inconsistencies.

### User Stories
- As a developer, I want to quickly set up my development environment so that I can start contributing immediately
- As a developer, I want to work on multiple services simultaneously so that I can develop and test integrated features
- As a team lead, I want to ensure consistent development environments so that we avoid "works on my machine" issues
- As a new team member, I want clear setup instructions so that I can onboard quickly

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Single unified development container with all required tools
- [ ] Support for multiple runtime environments (Node.js, Python, Rust)
- [ ] Consistent development experience across all services
- [ ] Integrated debugging support for all supported languages
- [ ] Hot reload capability for development
- [ ] Shared configuration and tooling across services
- [ ] Resource-efficient container management

#### Non-functional Requirements
- [ ] Setup time under 15 minutes for new developers
- [ ] Resource usage within specified limits
- [ ] Consistent performance across different host systems
- [ ] Clear documentation and onboarding guides
- [ ] Security best practices implementation

## Technical Design

### Architecture

#### Components
1. **Development Platform Repository**
   - Base container configurations
   - Shared development scripts
   - Documentation and guidelines
   - Service templates

2. **Service Repositories**
   - Service-specific code
   - Extended container configurations
   - Service-specific tooling

3. **Development Container**
   - Base development image
   - Runtime environments
   - Development tools
   - Debugging capabilities

### Component Design
```typescript
// Development Container Configuration
interface DevContainerConfig {
  name: string;
  dockerComposeFile: string[];
  service: string;
  workspaceFolder: string;
  remoteUser: string;
  features: {
    node?: string;
    python?: string;
    rust?: string;
    'docker-in-docker'?: boolean;
  };
  customizations: {
    vscode: {
      extensions: string[];
      settings: Record<string, unknown>;
    };
  };
}

// Service Configuration
interface ServiceConfig {
  name: string;
  type: 'node' | 'python' | 'rust';
  dependencies: string[];
  devDependencies: string[];
  scripts: Record<string, string>;
}
```

```

### Dependencies
- Docker Engine 24.0+
- VS Code with Remote Containers extension
- Git 2.40+
- Make 4.0+

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Base Infrastructure
- [ ] Create development platform repository
- [ ] Implement base development container
- [ ] Set up shared configuration templates
- [ ] Create development scripts

### Phase 2: Service Integration
- [ ] Implement service templates
- [ ] Create service-specific configurations
- [ ] Set up multi-service development workflow
- [ ] Implement debugging configurations

### Phase 3: Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Create onboarding guides
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides

## Testing Strategy

### Environment Tests
- Container build verification
- Resource usage monitoring
- Performance benchmarks
- Multi-service integration tests

### Workflow Tests
- Development setup procedures
- Service initialization
- Hot reload functionality
- Debugging capabilities

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Setup guide
- [ ] Development workflows
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Best practices
- [ ] Service templates
- [ ] Configuration reference

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Development environment setup time < 15 minutes
- [ ] Zero "works on my machine" issues
- [ ] 100% service compatibility
- [ ] Positive developer feedback
- [ ] Reduced onboarding time

## Security Considerations
- Container security best practices
- Development secrets management
- Access control and permissions
- Secure volume mounts

## Performance Requirements
- Initial setup: < 15 minutes
- Container startup: < 30 seconds
- Hot reload: < 2 seconds
- Memory usage: < 2GB per service
- CPU usage: < 50% per service

## Future Considerations
- Cloud development environments
- Additional runtime support
- CI/CD integration
- Remote development capabilities
- Team collaboration features
