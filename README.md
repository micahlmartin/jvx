# JVX - JSON Visual eXplorer 🎨

> A powerful and intuitive JSON visualization tool

## About JVX

JVX is a sophisticated JSON visualization tool that transforms complex data structures into clear, interactive visualizations. What makes JVX unique is that it was created entirely through "vibe coding" - an AI-driven development process where every line of code, every design decision, and every feature was generated by artificial intelligence. Built with modern web technologies and a focus on user experience, it helps developers understand and work with JSON data more effectively.
