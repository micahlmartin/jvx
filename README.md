# JVX - JSON Visual eXplorer 🎨

> A powerful and intuitive JSON visualization tool

## About JVX

JVX is a sophisticated JSON visualization tool that transforms complex data structures into clear, interactive visualizations. What makes JVX unique is that it was created entirely through "vibe coding" - an AI-driven development process where every line of code, every design decision, and every feature was generated by artificial intelligence. Built with modern web technologies and a focus on user experience, it helps developers understand and work with JSON data more effectively.

## Contributing 🤝

We welcome contributions from the community! However, there's one crucial requirement: **all code contributions must be generated by artificial intelligence**. No human-written code will be accepted. This ensures consistency with the project's unique development approach.

### Development Guidelines

1. **AI-Generated Code**: All code must be generated by AI tools
2. **Code Quality**: Write clear, maintainable code
3. **Documentation**: Include helpful comments and documentation
4. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
5. **Collaboration**: Maintain professional and constructive communication
6. **Consistency**: Follow established project patterns

### How to Contribute

1. Use AI tools to generate your code changes
2. Fork the repository
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
4. Commit your AI-generated changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
6. Open a Pull Request
