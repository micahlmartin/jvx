# Contributing to JVX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to JVX! This document will guide you through the contribution process.

## Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository

2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jvx.git
   cd jvx
   ```

3. Open the project in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. When prompted "Reopen in Container", click "Reopen in Container"
   - This will build the development container
   - Install all dependencies
   - Set up the development environment

   If you don't see the prompt:
   1. Press `F1` or `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`
   2. Type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   3. Press Enter

The development server will start automatically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

1. Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
2. Use TypeScript for all new code
3. Use meaningful variable and function names
4. Add comments for complex logic
5. Keep functions small and focused

### Component Guidelines

1. Follow React best practices
2. Use functional components with hooks
3. Keep components small and reusable
4. Use proper TypeScript types
5. Follow accessibility guidelines

### Documentation

All new features and changes should be properly documented:

1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Add JSDoc comments to functions and components
3. Update README if necessary
4. Document any configuration changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit a pull request

Your pull request should:
- Have a clear title and description
- Reference any related issues
- Include documentation updates
- Follow our code style guidelines (enforced by ESLint/Prettier)
